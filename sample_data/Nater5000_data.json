            "title": "Splitting Network Data to Two Devices (Network Tap?)",
            "selftext": "Greetings r/networking!\n\nI'm trying to build something which I *think* should be simple, but while doing some digging I'm getting a bit confused, so I'm hoping someone can clear up my understandings.\n\nBasically, I have a stereo camera which sends data over an ethernet line to a host machine. What I want to do is \"split\" that ethernet line so that the data can be sent to two machines simultaneously: the host machine and a logging machine. The camera and the host machine should work the same as without this split while the logging machine receives a copy of all the data sent to the host machine so that it can, well, log the data without interfering with main system. My understanding is that we ought to be looking at a network tap, but there are aspects of this approach that seem a bit confusing to me.\n\nSome more details:\n\n1. Our goal is to minimize complexity and to make this logging machine as \"optional\" and non-critical as possible. That is, the logger should be able to get plugged in and just start working automatically without any additional configuration in the main system, and if the logger fails, the rest of the system should just keep operating without any issues.\n2. The camera system produces a lot of data, so we can't slow it down (hence why I'm focusing on something passive rather than incorporating a switch, etc.). It's also critical, so we don't want the logger to be a bottleneck or point of failure.\n3. We're mostly interested in the data coming off the camera (i.e., the flow of traffic in one direction), so we don't need to know what data is being passed from the host machine to the camera. The camera system uses UDP, so I believe we \"just\" need to capture those packets to get the data we want.\n\nNow, in *my* mind, we *should* be able to get away with something like a [basic ethernet splitter](https://www.amazon.com/LIEZHUA-Gigabit-Ethernet-Splitter-Simultaneously/dp/B0CGV5FDWM), since really all we need is a copy of the same exact signals being sent to the host machine from the camera. However, that seems *too* simple when [devices like this exist](https://www.amazon.com/midBit-Technologies-LLC-100-1000/dp/B0175EODCE) which seem to start around $200. When looking around, I see people mention devices like the [Throwing Star LAN Tap](https://www.amazon.com/Throwing-Original-Monitoring-Ethernet-Communication/dp/B0CH4ZLJ3F) which, again, is a lot cheaper than these $200 devices. It's also a bit perplexing why that basic ethernet splitter I linked requires external power while these throwing start LAN taps don't (I think).\n\nI imagine the difference in these devices come from different capabilities needed for the application, and I'm hoping that, for my application, we could get away with a very simple solution. However, networking is *not* my area of expertise, so I'm just trying to understand why there's such a huge difference in price, configurations, etc. I'm also trying to identify any part of this system that I'm just completely getting wrong, like how passively consuming a copy of a UDP stream would work.\n\nAny clarification, help, or direction would be appreciated!\n\nEdit: thanks for the discussion so far! Just wanted to add a few details which might help:\n\n1. We sell these cameras to customers who can have them configured in different ways. These devices are not very consumer friendly, so adding too much complexity isn't an option. This is why a \"pure\" hardware solution would be nice: it's a lot easier to get a customer to correctly configure how some ethernet lines are configured than it is to get them to run our software on their machine, etc. The \"dream\" is to just ship a separate device that the customer can just plug in without needing to configure or think about. Part of this is that it'd have to be optional and modular. We want to avoid building this into the camera itself because many customers will explicitly\u00a0*not*\u00a0want these extra capabilities for various reasons (it also helps to keep things modular for the sake of our production, etc.).\n2. I'm not sure what differences exist between the cameras out there, but here are the [docs for the cameras](https://docs.carnegierobotics.com/) I'm talking about. I suspect some of the suggestions assume something a bit simpler. These are effectively robotics modules, and I'd be capturing independent image messages (e.g., like via ROS). Not sure how much this changes things, but features you'd expect to find in traditional camera systems may not apply here. I'll add that there is other data that comes off of these cameras that aren't images that we'd also want to capture.\n3. We *really* want to avoid introducing hardware like switches into the mix. There's likely going to be a switch involved somewhere down the line anyways which will be the customer's switch and not ours so relying on it to be configured correctly is a hard sell. Adding more switches to the mix just to support this logger may be a bit too \"heavy\" to warrant. If it's truly the only way to handle this effectively, then so be it, but the hope is that we can do something much more passive, cheap, plug-and-play, etc.\n4. Some people have asked about multicast. To be honest, I'm not sure what that means on a technical level. These cameras a pretty complex pieces of hardware designed for things like robotics use-cases, and I *suspect* that a feature you'd expect to find in a traditional camera system won't be available. I'm asking around on this now.\n\nFor added context, I'm a cloud engineer and not someone who is familiar with these cameras nor with this kind of networking. My interactions with these cameras is purely through the data they end up producing which, by the time it gets to me, come in the form of ROS bags. My current task is figuring out if we can get the data from the camera to the cloud efficiently and conveniently, which is why I'm asking the specific questions I am.\n\nThanks everyone!",

            "selftext": "We keep some money in a QuickBook Checkings account, and two days ago two transactions occurred which completed drained the account. One was for the balance in one of our \"envelopes\" while the other was for the rest. Both transactions had a description of \"Balance Refund.\" We're not seeing that money in any of our banks, and we can't find any more information through the online app. We've only ever transferred money into this account from one of our banks and have only ever transferred money out to the state to pay taxes. Luckily it's not a catastrophic amount of money, but it's enough that it can't be ignored.\n\nWe've tried for an hour today to get through to support, but we keep failing the verification challenge and we're not sure what information we're not providing properly, so we've given up on that route for now. Our account is only accessible by three people, and we use MFA, etc. No other weird behavior has been spotted.\n\nDoes anybody have any clue what this is? Is this a legitimate fraudulent charge? Or is QuickBooks doing something weird here? On May 14th, we got an email saying that we needed to update information in our QB Checking account or it would be suspended in 15 days, but it didn't make sense since all of our information was already up to date, then, 5 days later, we got another email from QB saying that email was sent in error and to ignore it, so we figured it was all good. Could that be related?\n\nAlso, if anybody is reading this and wondering if they should use QuickBook Checkings or not, my recommendation is to definitely not to. I can't get any information from anyone despite being able to provide them any detail they want. The support line is awful, the waits are long, the people on the other end are hard to hear and apathetic, and they just had me calling back to spin the wheel on which set of 6 pieces of information they needed without telling me what information I'm incorrectly providing *despite* telling them exactly what is listed in the account. So, you know, it's not a fun experience when all of the money from your account has been drained and nobody is willing to even let you know if they have any clue why that occurred. We're certainly not putting any more money in that account.",

            "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nI've recently tried working with the [Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch LCD 1.28](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-1.28), and I'm having issues getting the screen to work when running MicroPython.\n\nThis is actually the *second* one of these I've tried (thinking I might have goofed the first one up at some point), but I'm seeing the same behavior. When I first open the device and plug it in, the screen works and I can see the demo program on it. I then flash it with MicroPython (following that wiki page as well as [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4ZVXwt5ueA)), but when I load the demo Python files and run them with Thonny, the screen is just off. MicroPython works (I can run them via Thonny and see things print to the console), but I can't get the screen to turn on, let alone display anything.\n\nWhen I run the \\`alien.py\\` demo, i.e., the following code:\n\n    import gc\n    import random\n    from machine import Pin, SPI\n    import gc9a01\n    \n    gc.enable()\n    gc.collect()\n    \n    \n    def main():\n        '''\n        Decode and draw jpg on display\n        '''\n        tft = gc9a01.GC9A01(\n            SPI(2, baudrate=80000000, polarity=0, sck=Pin(10), mosi=Pin(11)),\n            240,\n            240,\n            reset=Pin(14, Pin.OUT),\n            cs=Pin(9, Pin.OUT),\n            dc=Pin(8, Pin.OUT),\n            backlight=Pin(2, Pin.OUT),\n            rotation=0)\n            \n        # enable display and clear screen\n        print(\"enabling screen\")\n        tft.init()\n        print(\"screen enabled\")\n    \n        # display jpg in random locations\n        while True:\n            tft.rotation(random.randint(0, 4))\n            tft.jpg(\n                \"alien.jpg\",\n                random.randint(0, tft.width() - 30),\n                random.randint(0, tft.height() - 30),\n                gc9a01.FAST)\n    \n    \n    main()\n\nI can see it print \"enabling screen\" and \"screen enabled,\" but then nothing actually happens on the screen. If run their demo \"cst816s\\_example.py\", I get an error:\n\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\n      File \"<stdin>\", line 6, in <module>\n      File \"cst816.py\", line 109, in __init__\n      File \"cst816.py\", line 146, in stop_sleep\n      File \"cst816.py\", line 113, in _i2c_write\n    OSError: [Errno 19] ENODEV\n\nResetting the device doesn't do anything while I'm connected to my PC, but when I just connect the device to power and press the reset the button, the screen *does* turn on, but it's just black. If I setup \\`boot.py\\` to load any of these scripts (like alien.py), nothing happens (the screen turns on, but it's just black).\n\nI've erased it, re-flashed it, tried different MicroPython .bins, tried different configurations, tried different USB cords, etc., and none of it helps.\n\nI'm pretty inexperienced with microcontrollers, but I have used them before (including ESP32s with screens running MicroPython), so I'm pretty sure I'm not making some obvious mistake. And, like I said, this is the second one I got and it's doing the same exact thing, so I don't think it's the hardware.\n\nDoes anybody see what I might be doing wrong? Or how I might approach troubleshooting this? I feel like I'm at a bit of a dead-end. I *haven't* tried using Arduino to test it. I started to, but it got complicated enough that I wanted to make sure I've exhausted all of my other options before dedicating that time (mostly since I *need* to use MicroPython).\n\nAny help or suggestions are appreciated!

I didn't go to University because i failed the entrance exams twice. (I'm in Europe, there's no community college or military here like in the US). I tried getting a trade but i failed miserably. I was also born with a heart condition that doesn't allow me to lift heavy weights and i also suffer from an autoimmune neurological disease.\n\n>Since i graduated I've worked a little bit in dead end jobs like warehouses etc. But I have nothing to currently put in my CV (I've been unemployed for 1.5 year now). All of my friends have left me, they think that im a loser so nobody hangs out with me anymore. I don't have anyone that i can call a friend. I've spend the past 4 years mostly in my house playing video games and watching movies. I have no social life, it's very awkward and hard for me to talk to people irl. I think that everyone I talk to gets weirded out in some extent, but it's maybe because I've been alienated for a long time now. It also doesn't help that im incredibly ugly too and my face is malformed\n\n>I can't also do simple tasks like for example, drive. I can't drive to save my life (we only have manuals here). Every time i sit behind the wheel i think that im gonna kill myself because I'm not \"smart\" enough. I'm very slowly compared to everyone else , i feel like everyone is moving too fast on the road and that my reflexes are terrible. I also seem to not have a good sense of space. I find it hard to park in small spaces or stay on my lane in highways.\n\n>I was never diagnosed with a mental or a learning disability but I'm genuinely incredibly bad and clumsy at everything i try. I used to have an incredible memory but now i forget everything i read after a few minutes. I find it hard understanding simple tasks and there are times when my 10 year old cousins beat me in games like puzzles.\n\n>Every one from my school has already graduate from university and is either working or doing their masters. And I'm still currently at the same place i was after i graduated. I don't see any way out of it. I have no prospects, talent or drive to do anything. There's nothing that really interests me in life and I'm generally very afraid of everything.\n\n>My family is also a mess. I don't want to go in depth, but the relationships between us are shattered. I feel like a leech because i still live with my parents and they still feed me, but I'm not capable of standing on my own feet atm. (most people live their parents home until they become 30 in my country)\n\n>2025 gave me a panic attack. I think that it's only going downhill from now on. Every year i get worse and worse. The only good thing is that i don't use any kind of drugs (weed, alcohol etc) and that I have a relatively normal weight.\n\n>Is there any way that i could improve? I've been in the same loop for 4 years now. Is it possible to escape? Bare in mind that I'm probably neurodivergent but it's so hard to get diagnosed in my country...\n\nJust keeping this for future reference!",

We managed to fix the leak by replacing the valve, but now we're not sure how to proceed with dealing with potential water damage. We did dry everything to our best abilities and got a large dehumidifier which we put in the basement and have been running non-stop, but we're not sure if we need to call a professional to handle this, or if there's anything else we should do to treat the issue ourselves, or if there's someway to figure out what kind of damage we may be looking at, etc.\n\nWhen we first noticed the leak, we made an appointment for a plumber (which is scheduled for tomorrow), but we're probably going to cancel that since we have resolved the actual plumbing issue. But now we're not sure if the next step should be to hire someone to assess and handle the actual water damage, or if that is something we can do ourselves. I don't mind spending the money to do this the right way, but my concern is that hiring anybody to handle this kind of problem will always opt for the more \"cautious\" (i.e., expensive) approach when it may not be necessary.\n\nAny thoughts on this?

            "selftext": "Greetings!\n\nI've been working on an application which is based around relatively large time series data which I'm storing in PostgreSQL, and I'm looking for some validation/criticisms of a plan to deal with a new feature.\n\nFor context, we're running PostgreSQL 14 in Aurora Serverless (we'll probably be upgrading to 15 soon, though). We have a table, `record`, which is partitioned by a UUID column, `log_id`. The `record` table contains our time series data, and the relevant columns are a BIGINT `timestamp` column, the UUID `log_id` column, a UUID `topic_id` column, and a JSONB `data` column. The record table has a composite primary key based on `log_id`, `topic_id`, and `timestamp`. These tables can get pretty large, storing up to 10 million rows each. Currently, we've avoided foreign-keys on this table to improve performance (we can warrant this due to how \"detached\" the `record` table is from the rest of the application). I'm open to suggestions/criticisms on this setup, but we've found that it works quite well for our application, mostly because our access patterns are based around always including a `log_id` and `topic_id` filter in our queries.\n\nNow, the `data` field is where things get interesting. This JSONB field is currently constrained to being somewhat small (under 64kb), but we want to allow larger data in this field (say, up to 1mb). My expectation is that this can cause significant increases in memory usage (among other things) and degrade performance. To counter this, I'm considering using a subpartition on the `record` table based on `topic_id`. This seems pretty natural considering the table's current configuration and our access patterns.\n\nWith that being said, topics aren't as \"nice\" as logs in our application's context. Each log can have up to 1,000 topics, and some of those topics may have very little (if any) records. The expected size of the `data` column is also generally consistent across a given topic, meaning that there can be one topic with few records and small-sized data while another topic can have many records with large data. These \"hotspots\" lead me to question if partitioning by `topic_id` would actually be effective. Furthermore, we'll be introducing many more partitions as a result, which is concerning. Although the query patterns ought to make these deficits somewhat negligible, I fear that I'm going to be introducing some serious overhead that I'm not currently aware of which may be costly. Of course I'll be running tests to verify things, I figured seeing other's thoughts would be a good idea.\n\nSo, anybody have opinions on this? It seems reasonable on paper, but it wouldn't be the first time a database optimization seemed reasonable and turned out to be a disaster. Really my focus is mitigating exceptional increases in memory usage due to the larger `data` field. I'll also add that I'd love to use Timescale here, but we have to stick with Aurora Serverless, making that not feasible.\n\n**tl;dr:** We have a partitioned table based on a `log_id` column. Almost all queries include both a `log_id` and a `topic_id` filter. We're going to be allowing users to store more data in these rows, and we want to mitigate potential performance degradation by creating a subpartition based on `topic_id`. Partitions are scary, so I'm looking for second opinions.",

Since we're not doing anything particularly fancy, I figured an out-of-the-box solution would probably work well, and it could save considerable development time for a feature which is ultimately just a \"nice to have.\"\n\nI'm not only curious about a backend solution, but a front-end solution as well.

            "selftext": "Greetings r/aws,\n\nI've been trying to figure out an optimal database configuration for dealing with large, partitioned tables in PostgreSQL, and was hoping others had some insight into this.\n\nI need to store a lot of timeseries data into a table (potentially up-to billions of rows), and I'm convinced table partitioning would make the most sense.  The data comes in discrete chunks which form natural partitions, so I'd probably use LIST partitioning over RANGE partitioning given the typical query patterns.  Based on this strategy, each partition can have up-to dozens of millions of rows, and there could be thousands of partitions.\n\nNow, I'm not too sure how this will actually work out in practice (I've never dealt with this kind of scale before, but based on what I've read, it's not *too* crazy), but I'm getting hung-up on the infrastructure decisions.  Aurora Serverless would be *really* nice to have, since the application is serverless (and I'd be leveraging the Data API) and the scaling features of Aurora Serverless make a lot of sense for the application's usage.  However, Aurora Serverless only supports up to PostgreSQL 10.14, which *does* have partitioning functionality, but it's apparently significantly less robust than what the later versions offer.  It's tolerable to use provisioned Aurora, which would let us use up to PostgreSQL 12.6, but this is a significant trade-off that we'd only want to make if it was *really* worth it.\n\nMy question is: based on these specifications, would you try to make Aurora Serverless work?  Or am I going to run into issues which will force us to use a later version of PostgreSQL, and thus provisioned PostgreSQL, down the line anyways?  My main concern is dealing with the partitioning, which I believe is going to be the \"trick\" that makes this work at scale, and how the choice between serverless vs provisioned will affect this choice.\n\nObviously this is probably not something that can be determined without implementing something and seeing how it works.  I'm hoping the serverless approach will work, but I just want to avoid investing a lot of time into that approach if it turns out this is doomed from the start based on some detail I wasn't aware of.\n\n**tl;dr:** Aurora Serverless limits PostgreSQL version to 10.14 while Aurora provisioned offers PostgreSQL 12.6.  Partitioning in PostgreSQL matured significantly between versions 10 and 12.  I'm trying to understand the trade-offs between using serverless vs using PostgreSQL 12 in terms of dealing with very large, partitioned tables.",

Of course, if it's something where the traffic gets bad *in* Lawrenceville, and the commute time from across the river and over the bridge is relatively negligible, then it may not make sense to pay *that* much more to get closer. \n\nIf it matters: I live with my girlfriend (we're both in our mid/late 20s), and we do like exploring and checking out restaurants, shops, cafes, etc. on foot where we live now (Elmwood in Buffalo, NY). We've visited Pittsburgh before (a few times only briefly), and we'll be visiting more in the following months, but I'd like to get an idea as to what I should be looking for in terms of neighborhoods and boundaries and stuff.\n\nAny other advice or suggestions would be appreciated.

I forget most of the details, but I believe it's black and white and is narrated by a female.  The comic is essentially the narrator listing off things they like about autumn.  The last two panels has the narrator's character looking at a set of small gourds/pumpkins, with the last frame showing the character hovering over and oggling the vegetables.\n\nI can't find it anywhere, mostly due to how many comics are made about this topic every year.  I'm looking for this one, specifically, because the character's face in the last two frames is funny.\n\nI don't have much more to offer in terms of details.  Any help would be appreciated!",

            "selftext": "Greetings r/aws!\n\nI'm currently working on a project where we're trying to build a suitable database migration process for our serverless application.  We've decided to go with something [similar to this](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/building-a-cross-account-continuous-delivery-pipeline-for-database-migrations/), where we're using CodeBuild to run migrations against our Aurora Serverless PostgreSQL database via Flyway.  This works pretty well, but I'm having a hard time figuring out a good backup and/or rollback solution, and was hoping ya'll might have some pointers.\n\nSpecifically, we're trying to move away from scripted rollbacks (i.e., writing the \"up\" and \"down\" migration) and, instead, would like to rely on DB snapshots.  This comes from (a) having to rarely use rollbacks (so it's a fair amount of dev time that potentially never sees use), (b) rollbacks being prone to failure anyways (which can cause even bigger issues), and (c) point-in-time restorations being robust.  There are of course drawbacks, but basically we run migrations infrequently enough and after decent testing that we'd rather treat rolling back as a last resort rather than a part of the process.\n\nWhich leads to our current issue: there doesn't seem to be a way to roll an Aurora Serverless DB back in-place.  That is, whether we create a snapshot or rely on the \"Restore to point in time\" feature, we're always required to create a new DB rather than to update the existing database.  It would seem, if this is the route we wanted to pursue, rolling back a database would require us to essentially spin up a copy of the database then point the application to the new database.  This isn't infeasible, but seems a bit \"clunky\" in terms of having to mitigate issues in production or something.\n\nCan anyone confirm that this is the case?  And does anyone have any tips on how to handle such a process in this setting?  We're convinced, and it seems like many others are to, that writing the \"down\" scripts for our migrations is simply not worth it (although I'd be willing to reconsider if there's a good argument), to the extent that I'd rather setup the infrastructure to handle rolling back using the \"cloned\" DB approach if needed.\n\nIf this is the only way of doing this, does anyone have any pointers as to a best approach?  My idea would be, at that point, that our CodeBuild project would create a copy of the database first, apply the migration, then we'd switch the DB the application is pointing to once we've confirmed the DB wasn't borked.  This seems like the most robust approach, but it starts to lead into questions of Blue-Green deployments that we're not prepared to address at the time (but that we might have to, if needed).\n\nAny other thoughts or suggestions are welcome!",

I've been tasked with experimenting using this function, and I need to figure out if it utilized a 2D FFT when 2D data is passed. It's been a while since I've worked directly with Fourier Transforms, and unfortunately the source code is hard to decipher, so I'm hoping someone knows the answer off the top of their head (and provide some sort of justification) so that I can move on without spending much time on this issue.\n\nI think it does, since the shape of the input affects the shape of the output data (i.e., passing in 1D data returns 1D data, passing in 2D data returns 2D data). However, I'm not even sure what this process is doing nor what it's even returning (aside from what the docs say), so I need something I little more explicit to tell my professor when he inevitably grills me on this.\n\nFor a bit more context: I'm trying to reproduce the processing of some previous work in which they calculate the power spectral density of gray-scale images in order to calculate a similarity between the images. So the expectation is that we use 2D FFT (versus reshaping the image to 1D and using 1D FFT) so as to capture spatial features of the image. I'm not in signal processing or anything, so it'd be very useful to be able to use this function without having to dig in much deeper, but I'm also open to any other suggestions or direction.",

            "selftext": "The [Installment Collar](https://www.cboe.com/blogs/options-hub/2015/07/30/options-strategy-the-installment-collar) (which might also be called a Calendar or Diagonal Collar?) basically has one buy long term puts and selling short term calls on owned shares.\n\nThere a plenty of variations on this strategy, and it's quite flexible in terms of risk/reward management.  I've been testing some approaches, given certain constraints, that seems to provide decent returns for minimal risk and effort.\n\nCurrently, my plan is to buy 100 shares of SPY, buy an ATM PUT that expires in \\~2 months (say, July 17th), and sell weekly/bi-weekly ATM CALLs.  The choice of selling ATM PUTs/CALLs is inefficient, but \"effortless\" in the since that you'll know your total risk upfront (i.e., the cost of the PUT) and you'll know you're semi-weekly reward upfront (i.e., you know what you take home from the CALLs).  You profit when the premium you've collected from selling CALLs is greater than the cost of the PUT.\n\nThis strategy works well in the current market conditions as implied volatility it relatively high, making the difference between the cost of the PUT and the cumulative premium of the CALLs high.  This means that a potential risk would be that implied volatility decreases, causing the premium on the CALLs to decrease.  This is why the choice of buying a mid-term PUT (versus something longer out which would produce more profit) is incorporated here.\n\nThe choice of SPY is also important since (a) it has excellent volume and bi-weekly options, (b) it's less volatile than company stocks or most other ETFs with good options, and (c) it has decent dividends.  Again, this adds the the \"effortless\" aspect of this strategy, as it's a safe choice for investing in general, but obviously more active selections can increase such gains.\n\nAt the onset, we buy (or already own) shares of SPY, buy the PUT, and sell the CALL.  By the time the CALL expires, either the price increases, causing the CALL to be exercised and us losing the stock (or we can roll it up), or it stays the same/decreases, causing the CALL to expire worthless.\n\nIf the price stays the same/decreases and the CALL expires worthless, we can sell another CALL against it (and so on).  If the price decreases significantly, our losses from holding the stock is offset by the increase in value from PUT.  Here, we can sell the PUT (yielding back the difference), then buy another ATM PUT for the same (or possibly future, to roll forward) expiration.  The idea is to continuously keep our PUT near the price of the stock to limit downside risk.\n\nIf the price increases and the CALL is exercised/rolled up, we buy the stock again/continue holding it and continue to sell CALLs against it.  We can even roll the PUT up and back, at the cost of time value, to capture upward movements (as long as value gained offsets the time we lose to sell CALLs against it).\n\nBased on the numbers of I've been working with, this would produce a decent profit (conservatively +1% per month) if nothing drastic occurs in the market.  However, the real value of this strategy is that it caps loss, which allows us to leverage margin efficiently.  Since we can be highly leveraged, the premium and dividends we receive are that much more valuable without risk of a margin call.\n\nThis also means that sudden decreases in prices aren't felt by our strategy (of course, neither are increases).  Although I'm bullish, I wouldn't be surprised if another crash occurs in the near future.  This strategy mitigates this risk entirely, since the value of our PUT will cover *any* loss in value from our stock.\n\nThe lack of upside potential is probably a turn off for many people, since selling ATM CALLs basically guarantees no upside potential beyond the premium of the CALLs we sell.  Of course, I'd say this is *the* price to pay for such consistent income.\n\nIt seems the true risk, as I mentioned earlier, can come from a decrease in implied volatility.  However, volatility doesn't tend to sharply decrease (only increase), making such events rather predictable.  This might make this strategy unfeasible in smoother markets (i.e., pre-COVID), but currently it looks ripe.\n\nI'm trying to spot flaws in my logic or other potential risks.  Obviously what I described here is quite low-level, inefficient, and naive, but my idea is to replace a simple \"buy and hold\" strategy with something a little more predictable (and that can be refined over time).\n\nThoughts on this?  I've tried finding similar strategies, but, other than the \"Installment Collar\" description, it doesn't seem too popular.  It's certainly not the most lucrative strategy, but it's safety is quite valuable to me given my circumstances and the current state of the market.",

            "selftext": "Greetings r/MLQuestions,\n\nI know my way around the mechanics of probabilities, at least in the context of ML, but I lack the intuition for them and how to interpret them, especially in the setting of ML.  I'm hoping to gain some other perspectives on the subject and to get some direction as to how I can learn more about it.\n\nSpecifically, I'm currently tasked with analyzing images and determining similarity between them based on high-level semantic features.  This brought me to [\"A Metric for Distributions with Applications to Image Databases\"](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~tomasi/papers/rubner/rubnerIccv98.pdf) and the Earth Mover's Distance, which seems like a spot-on place to start.  I'm aware of EMD through WGANs, but have really only looked at it in contrast to measures like KL divergence.  I get the intuition for EMD (I think) and have been able to implement it with expected results, but I can't quite mend the gap in my thoughts between the quantities we observe and use in the context of ML versus probability distributions.\n\nAs an example: with my set of black-and-white images, I can perform image segmentation to extract groups of pixels with similar colors.  Any given image can have anywhere between 1 and *k* of these components.  We could do something like calculate some statistic for these components (e.g., ratio of black to white pixels in it's bounding box), so that a given image corresponds to a basket of *n* such measures (where *n* is between 1 and *k*).\n\nIn other words, I'd say that each of these images correspond to a distribution of such values, and ranking their similarity via EMD produces the results I expect (even with this poor approach).  This makes sense to me, since we expect similar images to have similar features so that the distributions we construct will look similar for similar images, etc.\n\nNow, assuming I didn't get any of that wrong, I don't see how \"probability\" plays into this.  My guess is that, if we normalize the distributions I've created, we end up with \"probability distributions,\" at least mechanically.  However, I don't quite see how probability plays into this.  I suppose I'd interpret the distributions we've constructed as being samples from different distributions which we imagine being what has \"generated\" these images, but is this accurate?\n\nI guess I feel like I almost get the whole picture, but can't quite convince myself that what I'm looking at are probability distributions when no consideration of probabilities were used to actually construct them.  I'm worried that I'm incorrectly assuming that these do correspond to some actual probability distribution (or some notion of it), which will obviously make further progress difficult.\n\nThoughts?  Comments?  I can't quite ask any specific question cause I'm not even sure what the question is, but I'm hoping that perhaps others have felt the same way and were able to convince themselves of such connections in a way that I just haven't seen yet.

            "selftext": "First off, I am in the TensorFlow camp.  Specifically, I've been using Keras since Theano was a thing, so after it became clear that Theano wasn't gonna make it, the choice to switch to TensorFlow was natural.  Before TF v2, I would have concurred that PyTorch wins in general usability.  However, between Keras and the features of TF v2, I've had no difficulty with TensorFlow and, aside from some frustrations with the way the API is handled and documented, I'd assume it's as good as it gets.\n\nYet, I see time and time again people advocating for PyTorch over TensorFlow (especially on this sub).  To the point that someone asking a question about TensorFlow will receive multiple responses from people suggesting they switch.  Now, I've yet to read a *good* argument to switch, and, frankly, I can't imagine hearing an argument that would convince me to switch.  But these suggestions do seem to generally be given in good faith, and I'd be foolish to ignore such advice.  So, can anyone make a good argument advocating for either library?\n\nFor context, I've used PyTorch a number of times, and it seems fine.  Certainly easy to use, but not much easier than Keras and/or TFv2 (in my opinion).  I focus on reinforcement learning, so that might make a difference too.  I'm often having to write custom training loops and loss functions, but I'd guess that both are \"easily\" doable with either library.  I don't rely on dedicated services (i.e., I avoid ML platforms) and prefer to avoid vendor lock-in (usually opting for a containerized approach).\n\nDoes anyone have any specific arguments or can point me to any articles/videos/etc. advocating for the use of one library over the other?  My guess is that, on some level, it's going to depend on use-case and various preferences, but considering how quick people are to suggest switching libraries in the face of almost any challenge, I'm assuming there's a general argument that can be made.  I'm also interested in any general discussion on this.  There always seem to be this weird contention surrounded this conversation, and I don't think that's appropriate.  I'll use whatever library makes the most sense to use, and I'd hope others are doing the same regardless of the internet's opinion.  So if this just comes down to matter of preferences, then I'd be content with that resolution. \n\nThanks!",

            "selftext": "Greetings r/investing,\n\nAfter a fair amount of time of learning, saving, and some trading, I'm at the point where I'm looking to invest in a (relatively) lazy portfolio using cost dollar averaging.  Admittedly, I'm interested in more active trading, but due to being in a particularly busy time of my life, I know I won't have the time to do it properly.  Alas, the market doesn't wait for me, and I've reached my various personal finance goals to start looking at investing.\n\nMy plan is to start with something like a [lazy portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios) comprised of ETFs which have active options and pay decent dividends.  Obviously, sound financials and a properly balanced portfolio is a higher portfolio, but my hope is to spend the next 3 to 5 years building this portfolio so that when I move to the next phase of my life (i.e., completing grad school), I'll be setup to start in on more active trading, namely relatively-conservative [income options strategies](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/).\n\nWith this in mind, I have a few question regarding my overall plan, my selection of ETFs (or other securities), and some other details I haven't been able to find specific answers for.  Any advice or comments would be appreciated.\n\nFirst, at least to start, I planned on having 50% of my portfolio comprised of bonds.  I'm definitely willing to adjust this, but I feel anything over 50% would be too conservative for my situation (I'm 25 with disposable income) and I'm not willing to go below 25% as per Benjamin Graham's advice.  On top of this, I can't find anything that suggests I *shouldn't* utilize a Bond ETF over buying bonds directly.  To me, a bond ETF would be much preferred due to the simplification alone, but I'm weary that I'm interpreting the role of bonds incorrectly here.  My current plan is to invest 50% of my capital into TLT, although I considered a 25/25 split between TLT and HYG.\n\nSecond, I'm aiming for 25% of my capital to focus on the US market.  To me, the easy choice is SPY.  I'd be interested in exploring specific avenues at a later date, but to start, SPY makes the most sense to me.\n\nThird, I'd put 25% into gold.  Specifically, GLD.  It lacks dividends, but I can't seem to find a good alternative given my criteria.  Alternatively, I'd put 12.5% into international markets (specifically EFA) and the other 12.5% into GLD.  I think this would be slightly more aggressive, but it would give me some more dividend yield.\n\nOverall, my strategy looks like a simplified [Permanent portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios#Permanent_Portfolio).  I'd probably be investing once a month, which (at current prices) would cost me around $1,200 to keep balanced (e.g., 1xSPY + 4xTLT + 2xGLD).  This is currently yielding \\~1.5%, which I think is acceptable.\n\nI won't be able to actively trade options on any of this for a while, so by the time I have enough capital and time to do so, my portfolio will bound to be different.  Still, my goal is to study these ETFs and paper trade on them to see how such strategies may play out.\n\nAny thoughts?  I'm particularly interested in hearing what others think of the choices of ETFs I went with.  I'm sold on SPY, but I'm not very familiar with EFA and HYG, and I think, to start I'd, avoid them.  I'm somewhat familiar with TLT and GLD and their role in my portfolio is straight-forward, but I'm certainly willing to replace them if it makes sense to do so (although I'm going to be hesitant to buy bonds and gold directly).  Obviously as I go and do more research, I'd adjust, but I think this is a solid foundation, so I'm hoping others can either confirm this or shit on my plan.I just don't want to make this decision in a vacuum.  Thanks!\n\nEDIT: As I mentioned in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eonpxg/questions_regarding_lazy_portfolio_allocations/feea4td?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I'm simultaneously considering a slightly more complex portfolio, too, if anyone wants to weigh in.",

            "selftext": "Greetings r/aws,\n\nI've been playing around with AWS and want to start developing serverless apps \"the right way.\"  From what I can tell, CloudFormation seems like the first steps to doing this.  I'm somewhat comfortable with the pieces of the puzzle (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.), but I'm finding myself overwhelmed when trying to design a template in the CloudFormation template designer GUI.\n\nI can find the docs for each component (e.g., here's the docs for an [ApiGateway::Method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-method.html)), so I can find what properties are available, what they mean, which are required, etc., but I can't seem to find any reference to higher-level stuff, such as what components go into making a REST API, etc.\n\nObviously, at some level, these will boil down to design choices on my end.  Still, there are pieces of the puzzle that I think I'd miss without some sort of guide.  For example, I followed the \"[Build a Serverless Web Application](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/)\" guide where they offer  a CloudFormation template to create the static site hosting portion of the guide.  This template involves a number of components that I wouldn't have considered (such as the BucketPolicy or the S3Objects).  I see that the Lambda function and it's role aren't necessary in general, but how would I have been aware of the components required to get this part running?\n\nIf it just comes down to learning how these services work individually, that's fine.  But I can't find any docs or reference material which explain these components in such a way that I can translate them to CloudFormation parameters.  I'd prefer to figure out CloudFormation from the bottom up (if that even makes sense), and I'm not expecting to spin up production grade sites overnight, but there seems to be *too much* material offered by Amazon and I don't even know where to start.\n\nAnyone have any advice or pointers for getting started?  I can deal with using external tools for the time being, but my goal is to be able to start a project from scratch without having to rely on anything not standard for AWS.  If the best approach is formal training or something along these lines, that's fine too (although finding such training is still challenging).  If this doesn't seem feasible or if it seems like the wrong approach, I'm happy to adjust, but overall the whole thing seems too complex and a lack of straight-forward reference material makes me question my own approach.",

            "selftext": "Hey r/MLQuestions,\n\nI've been working on a project which is based on multi-agent reinforcement learning.  My professor tasked me with describing my approach through the lens of game theory.  I've, unfortunately, never studied game theory, but now is a better time than ever, I suppose.\n\nI've managed to pin down how I can frame my work as a cooperative game, but I have yet to understand why we'd do this in the first place.  Specifically, I don't see the connection between game theory and optimization problems (which is how I view RL tasks).  Through the papers I've been reading, I see how researchers setup a problem and deduce various game theoretic properties which, presumably, are nice, such as showing that the game has a non-empty core, but I don't understand what this means in the context of optimization.\n\nLike, let's say I properly model my cooperative game so that I can show it has a non-empty core.  This implies the grand coalition that is formed is stable, which means that, for my agents, they'll have no incentive to leave the grand coalition.  I can appreciate, at a high level, what this means for my solution.  But what does this give me, exactly?  Does this suggest that my approach has some quality which is useful in terms of the optimization problem (such as some form of convergence)?  Or is this weaker in that, for an optimization problem like this, a stable grand coalition is necessary for optimization to work (but doesn't guarantee the success of such a process)?\n\nMechanically, I think I'm grasping the notions of game theory enough to work with it in this context, but I feel I'm missing the overall point.  In the papers I've read, it seems like they spend a fair amount of time proving these game theoretic qualities of their problem, then they move on to the optimization task and the game theory is never \"used\" again.\n\nCan someone shed some light on this?  I'm really just looking for more intuitive explanations as to how game theory can be applied in this setting, but any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.  If it helps, one of the main papers I'm [referring to is here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00820.pdf), but I wouldn't get hung up on the details of this particular paper since it only resembles my work loosely.  Also, if anyone can suggest a better place to ask this question, I'd appreciate it to.  Thanks!",

I use 2000 as an example, but really any time frame that includes the better half of the 2000 to present would probably work fine, too.  I'm particularly interested in the economy surrounding the 2008 financial crisis, so I figured starting around the early 2000s recession would be suitable to give me a relatively complete picture.

            "selftext": "Hey r/buildapc, I'm looking to build a budget deep learning rig around two older GPUs I have.  The plan would be to have the hardware I buy be compatible with top of the line GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti), or at least leave enough room for upgrades.\n\nI currently have a desktop dedicated to deep learning that I use on a daily basis as my \"main\" computer (I host JupyterHub on it and develop directly on the machine through it).  It has a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 1GB in it that I'm running Tensorflow on.  Obviously the GPU isn't very heavy duty, but it is able to work faster than the CPU for deep learning, so I use it to prototype then deploy it in AWS.  Those instances, of course, are too expensive for continuous use, and between the increase in development time that I spend on the machine as well as the next semester quickly approaching, I'd like to \"upgrade\" my equipment towards a feasible solution.\n\nFrom my current desktop, the only piece I want to keep is the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 1GB.  The rest of the machine will be a secondary server.  I also have a ZOTAC GeForce GTX 970 4GB and a Corsair CX500 power unit.  I'm not sure if the power unit will be sufficient for my needs, but if it can at least run the two GPUs, I'd like to incorporate it in this build (and upgrade later if need be).\n\nOtherwise, here's my plan for the rest of the build:\n\n[PCPartPicker part list](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ws38q4) / [Price breakdown by merchant](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ws38q4/by_merchant/)\n\nType|Item|Price\n:----|:----|:----\n**CPU** | [AMD - Threadripper 1900X 3.8 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/BvgPxr/amd-threadripper-1900x-38ghz-8-core-processor-yd190xa8aewof) | $319.99 @ Amazon \n**CPU Cooler** | [Corsair - H100i v2 70.69 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/CrDzK8/corsair-cpu-cooler-cw9060025ww) | $129.89 @ OutletPC \n**Motherboard** | [Asus - PRIME X399-A EATX TR4 Motherboard](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/wMjWGX/asus-prime-x399-a-eatx-tr4-motherboard-prime-x399-a) | $299.97 @ B&H \n**Memory** | [Corsair - Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000 Memory](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/MYH48d/corsair-memory-cmk16gx4m2b3000c15) | $119.99 @ Amazon \n**Storage** | [Samsung - 860 Evo 1 TB 2.5\" Solid State Drive](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/yzfhP6/samsung-860-evo-1tb-25-solid-state-drive-mz-76e1t0bam) | $147.00 @ Amazon \n**Case** | [Corsair - Air 540 ATX Mid Tower Case](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/RbFPxr/corsair-case-cc9011048ww) | $149.99 @ Amazon \n**Power Supply** | [EVGA - SuperNOVA G3 750 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully-Modular ATX Power Supply](https://pcpartpicker.com/product/dMM323/evga-supernova-g3-750w-80-gold-certified-fully-modular-atx-power-supply-220-g3-0750) | $89.89 @ OutletPC \n | *Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts* |\n | Total (before mail-in rebates) | $1296.72\n | Mail-in rebates | -$40.00\n | **Total** | **$1256.72**\n | Generated by [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com) 2019-01-07 18:56 EST-0500 |\n\nI have concerns with compatibility, though, and especially between the GPUs.  I would like to use both the GPUs I have now in the build, then, when I decide to upgrade a GPU, switch out the lesser of the two for it (and probably put it back in the older machine).  The build above should work with two ZOTAC GeForce GTX 970 4GB according to pcpartpicker.com (according to the site, the build can also support two GeForce RTX 2080 Ti).  But I can't find the 650 on the site, and I'm not sure if mix-matching the types of GPUs would cause any issues.  Does anyone know if that would cause an issue?  Or if this motherboard would support the 650?  Since I'm using it for deep learning, the GPUs would run for separate (but possibly parallel) training.\n\nThe motherboard/CPU combo is kind of a tricky spot, since I want to be able to upgrade the CPU up to the Threadripper 32-core, but I'm not in need of a high-powered CPU at the moment.  The CPU I chose is simply the cheapest that would fit the motherboard (same with the cooler).\n\nIdeally, I'd like to keep the build under $1,000 (and I'm in the US), but I'm willing to invest more if it will allow me to upgrade later.  If the extra $250 gets me that, then I'm fine with it (although I might try looking for cheaper parts elsewhere).

I'd probably opt for as many warranties as I can get, but if something were to happen to it (electrical issue, fire, etc.), would my renters insurance cover it?",

Doesn't mean you should just tough it out or whatever, but considering you're questioning thing in your life beyond just your job, it's safe to say that you should probably start elsewhere in terms of getting a grip on whatever it is you need to rectify before seriously contemplating leaving your job.\n\nWith that being said, I don't think ML engineers are in a particularly special place at the moment, so I don't think you'd be passing up on some once in a lifetime opportunity by moving back into being a SWE. Arguably, MLEs are the ones being the most neglected in this market, since the hot thing is doing things with existing AI solutions rather than building the solutions themselves, which suggests that a SWE who is able to incorporate things like LLMs into larger systems is more valuable than an MLE who can create ML solutions which don't necessarily interact with these systems. But I wouldn't put much weight into any of that to begin with.\n\nI'm not sure if I'd be looking at a long break at this point, though. Kind of seems like people are playing a game of musical chairs, and I'm not sure I'd want to be on the sidelines figuring things out when the music stops. If you were to, say, find a *different* career opportunity that you think would suit you better and you transitioned to that instead, then that's a different story. But I suppose if you can even consider taking any sort of break, then you might not be in a situation where doing so would be foolish.\n\nRegardless, I *do* think you're over worrying about what ML would mean for your resume, but maybe under worrying about what it would mean to take a year off from work. I think most people would agree that being dynamic and aggressive in your career is *generally* a good approach. Hopping jobs because you've found that you actually don't like the role you recently found yourself in isn't a bad thing. Taking a year off, though, seems a bit egregious.",

There's plenty of reasons to do so in various contexts, but it basically comes down to business decisions that are more meaningful to the finance department than anything else.\n\nFor example, if you only have $100k to spend and a robot costs $1m to buy but $10k a month to lease, then you don't really have much of a choice but to lease it, no? Even if you could afford to buy it, would that capital be put to better use elsewhere? Or: is that robot a good *investment*? If it is going to be obsolete in a year, why buy it and be burdened with a rapidly depreciating piece of equipment when you can just lease it?\n\n>Isnt the robotic arms getting cheaper and a commodity?\n\nIf they're getting cheaper, then you *definitely* don't want to buy one.

But, if you're learning how something works *within* the context of what you do at your company, then that's a different story. It's less \"this person can teach you about this topic\" and more \"this person can show you a very relevant, real-life example of this thing and you two can share that knowledge, etc.\"\n\nI'll add that your non-tech boss probably doesn't care about your personal enrichment and is more interested in leveraging these technical skills for the business, so it'd make sense that they'd try to build some sort of cohesion between you and the other person. It just might be the case that they don't really understand what that actually looks like on a technical level, so they phrase it in the best way they can.\n\nRegardless, I wouldn't not actively dismiss what your boss is suggesting.

            "body": ">My entire view here is that this is about a universal lie. He can\u2019t utter any falsehoods regardless of whether he personally believes them or not.\n\nThat's not really a \"lie\" then. It's a false fact. *I'd* say that he explicitly can't lie based on the wish:\n\n[\"I wish, for only one day, dad couldn't tell a lie.\"](https://youtu.be/6eSyqE36hyg?si=XAxWUVJvQKsubOxN&t=73)\n\nSo the curse is not that he couldn't utter universal falsehoods, just that he couldn't lie. By definition, a [lie is an assertion that is believed to be false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie). I think it's fair to assume that this is effectively what the kid wishes for, given the context of the movie. He doesn't care if his dad is wrong about stuff; he doesn't want his dad to lie to him.\n\nMore concretely, a lie *must* be an assertion and the person making the assertion *must* believe it to be false. That's it.\n\nFor example, if we're willing to assume the Earth is not flat in reality but that I actually believe it is flat, then I could say \"the Earth is flat\" and that wouldn't be a lie because I don't believe such an assertion to be false.\n\n>So he can use this power to say \u201cthere is no afterlife,\u201d and if he can verbally say it, it must be true. And he can randomly guess the origin of life with the various theories that about, etc, till he\u2019s able to actually utter it out loud.\n\nIf he believes there is no afterlife, then he'd be able to say this. It wouldn't be a lie. It may still be false.\n\nAll of this is arguing semantics and not particularly important, but the reason I'm ranting is that your belief about the functionality of the curse actually diminishes one of the most important aspects of the movie: this curse let's him know what he actually *believes*, which is something much more grounded and more impactful from an emotional perspective. This point is driven home when he blurts out \"I'm a bad father.\" He has an epiphany at this point because he realizes he actually believes he is a bad father, not just that he is a bad father objectively.\n\nI think the distinction is subtle, but important, because he is forced to contend with the fact that he, himself, believes he is a bad father which is clearly something he hadn't recognized before. You don't need to have a magical curse placed on you to see that you're a bad father; you \"just\" have to recognize it yourself. This level of introspection is a constant challenge we all face, but it's something one *can* do without magical interference.\n\nIt's hard to do and it's a constant challenge we all face, but if there's anything to take away from the movie, it's that we *all* should take a step back and ask if we're lying to ourselves about these important aspects of our own lives. Jim Carrey's character could have feasibly figured this out himself, but he was so good at lying, he was able to lie to himself about it.\n\nAdditionally, I think this curse being more \"mystic\" and based on \"universal\" lies takes away from this message in that it's less impactful for there to be some objective way of asserting that he's a bad father. It's hard to imagine how the universe would measure such a quality, and if the movie *did* work this way, it'd come off as a bit more arrogant and obtuse (i.e., the writers are telling you, the audience, what constitutes a bad father in the universal sense) rather than how it works in terms of one's belief (i.e., it's up to you, the audience, to understand if *you* believe *you're* a bad father or not), which, to me, offers a much more impactful message given how actionable the result actually is.",

Obviously we're talking about something pretty complicated here, but at the end of the day, the Fed *needs* to manage inflation, otherwise things won't just get bad, but they'll become unmanageable. So it's not that things might end up costing more, but that things will spiral until the US (and possible world) economy completely fails. They're gonna try pretty hard to avoid that, and cooling the US economy is effectively how you do so.\n\n>I also hear interest rates are also way up and they are tightening the money.\n\n[Interest rates aren't particularly high](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS). They're lower than they were a year ago by a decent margin, and they're much lower than they have been in the past. They are relatively high compared to where they were during COVID, but that's because they dropped rates to near 0 during COVID to heat up the economy. In case you didn't hear, that caused inflation which a lot of people didn't like.\n\nIf it matters, the Fed was on pace to continue lowering interest rates, but paused doing so since there are inflationary policies being pushed by the current administration. Whether or not those policies are worth it is beyond the scope of this question, but the Fed is acting pretty logically by not continuing to lower rates when there are pretty strong external inflationary factors at play.",

You *are* getting work done when doing noncoding work, otherwise it wouldn't be noncoding *work*.\n\nMore concretely: you work at a company which needs more from its employees than just code. The stuff you do outside of coding is a necessary part of the job. The sooner you internalize that, the sooner you can use your time doing noncoding work more effectively.\n\nIn the same vein, be sure that your noncoding work is actually productive. It's easy to get in the habit of showing up to every little meeting that you get roped into, but if you're finding that you're not getting anything from them (or offering anything to them), then you need to excuse yourself from them. You're effectively acting as your own manager in this sense, and it's important part of your job as gain seniority. And, like u/slowd said, you can do this on a mechanical level by blocking out times of your day where you want to focus. Just be aware that if you completely avoid meetings, etc., then you won't be operating at the level that is expected of you as someone with more experience.\n\nAnd yes, it does get \"worse\" as you gain more experience, but, again, it's important to recognize that these meetings (and, in general, management) are *supposed* to be generating value. It's *your* job to ensure that *your* time is being used effectively. In that sense, if you do a good job managing yourself, then things won't get worse because what you'd be doing with your time will be more valuable.",

Furthermore, the naming scheme, itself, should be consistent across the board, e.g., buckets named \"scobble-storage-<env name>\", etc.\n\n*Within* the app, there should (usually) be enough isolation and context that incorporating \"scobble\" or the environment name isn't needed. Like, within the Scobble app, it is redundant to have variable names like \"ScobbleDbConnectionString\" *if* there is only ever one DB connection string to deal with, so you'd be better of with just \"DbConnectionString\". I'd even go a step further to say that if there are no other connection strings to consider, then you should just call it \"ConnectionString\" (although a *little* forward thinking is warranted here). If there *are* multiple connection strings at play, they *should* all be related to Scobble anyways, so whatever prefix/suffix you use to identify them should be more specific.\n\nOf course, much of this is nebulous and will evolve over time. The main consideration, for me, is ensuring uniqueness when required and making sure I can list/sort/query/etc. resources in a sane way, which is why I'd use name schemes like \"scobble-<purpose>-<env>\" so that, when I list these resources, I can quickly see I have X scobble resources, of which there are Y different groups of resources based on purpose, and for each purpose, there are Z different envs, etc. But this may be a bigger consideration for cloud engineers than for other contexts, etc.",

I'm on Unit 55 of 86 in Section 3 of 3. Not sure how that compares to others.\n\nAs far as it being good or bad: I think people really fail to understand the actual value of Duolingo. I've been loosely trying to learn Italian since I was in high-school over a decade ago, and I've basically made 0 progress until trying Duolingo. Even while using Duolingo, I've tried various books, apps, online courses, podcasts, etc., but none of them \"stuck.\"\n\nNow I feel pretty invested in learning Italian and I plan on taking some in-person courses when the new session at my local language school starts. I also got my fiancee into it, who had no particular interest in Italian, who has maintained basically the same streak as me (albeit, she's a bit further behind in terms of units). We can roughly communicate simple thoughts to one another in Italian.\n\nFor an added comparison, I took Spanish in school from 7th grade up through 10th grade (i.e., 4 semesters) and again in my Junior year of college (which was a 5 day-per-week class). I know Italian *way* better than I do Spanish (granted, I actually want to learn Italian).\n\nAll of that is to say: Duolingo isn't how you learn a new language, but it's a decent way to start learning a new language. It's easy to point to all sorts of better approaches and resources that technically teach new languages more effectively than Duolingo, but if you can't stick with them, then they're useless.",

A manager *might* be able to \"feel\" the performance of a team member slipping or not being up-to-par, but even then, they will be implicitly referring to metrics like \"time it takes to complete this kind of task\" when determining this.

Like, sure, in theory, an engineer could probably whip things together without using Google. But in practice it'd be pretty unreasonable to prevent them from using those kinds of materials. Managers *are* just people, after all, so expecting them to not use data to solve problems is pretty unreasonable, too.\n\n>And, can't you just pull this out of a board using points and cycle time?\n\nThese are just different ways of tracking time, except not as direct.

Without this information, it'd be hard for a manager to ever have any awareness of this kind of dynamic. And note that this kind of inference can occur even when the data is messy like how you've described.\n\nThe devs themselves wouldn't really see this value directly. In fact, the other 9 devs won't even feel as though their time tracking data is even really being utilized. But, in aggregate, it does provide value for the team and, more specifically, the managers as a whole.\n\nOf course, it's also the case that collecting this kind of data is hard and actually effectively utilizing this data is even harder, so this isn't to say that everyone collecting time tracking data is doing it properly and making it worth the effort. But this is more an issue with specific managers, organizations, processes, etc., than it is with the process itself.\n\nThe other commenters pointing to more cynical reasoning seem to be assuming that *they're* the ones that are supposed to be seeing value from this data. Engineers certainly could utilize this data to do things like help estimate tickets, etc., but that's pretty tough to do for the reasons mentioned. However, it should go without saying that someone managing a sufficiently large team of people who perform work outside the scope of the management's expertise will need to rely on various metrics to understand how their team is actually performing.

They knew there were plenty of restaurants they can go to where they can work for tips, so they had the leverage. So tips it is.\n\nEmployers don't receive a benefit from employing tipped a staff. Either the food is marked up to account for proper wages, in which case the increase in revenue goes towards payroll, or the food is \"discounted\" appropriately so that customers are willing to pay for it, knowing they'll also have to tip. I, the employer, never see any extra money regardless of the approach.\n\nI'm all for ending tip culture. But it starts with the servers, *not* the employers. Anybody who has ever worked with or as a tipped staff understands this.

Sure, quickly spinning up an EC2 instance for some quick work is probably something a tool like this can handle. But it's also something I can do easily. However, setting up anything non-trivial likely means it won't be static. So making a change to the infrastructure, troubleshooting issues, etc., will just become harder to deal with the less I understand about what is actually there.\n\nI hate to be a downer, but, as-is, it seems like you're solving a problem that very few people actually have. It's definitely not good for *anyone* to spin up infrastructure without knowing what they're spinning up. That problem is made much worse by not being able to audit, modify, etc., your infrastructure down the road. Tools like Terraform don't exist to make spinning up simple infrastructure easy; it makes managing non-trivial infrastructure possible. A tool like this can't replace that directly.\n\nWhat *would* make sense would be for this to use something like Terraform as an intermediate layer. That is, this generates the Terraform configuration for you, which you can then validate, modify, etc., then have this also handle executing that infrastructure configuration. Of course, that's when this basically resolves to just a dedicated AI agent tool, which is a hard sell when tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc., already exists.",

This doesn't mean you can't use the console to understand what is happening, but you should only create/update resources through Terraform (or whatever infrastructure management tool you want to use).\n\nYou should be able to set up a repo in GitHub which contains your application. I'd recommend Python if you don't have a preference, but any sensible language would work. This application should be set up to be able to tested locally easily while also be able to be deployed to Lambda. You should set up GitHub actions to build your application into an image, push the image to ECR, then update the Lambda to use the new image.\n\nSimilarly, you should be able to build a basic front-end that interacts with your service. This doesn't need to be super sophisticated (front-end engineering is a bit beyond the scope of a cloud engineer), but you should be able to feasibly test your solutions in an end-to-end fashion. Again, any front-end approach works (even basic HTML/CSS/JS), but learning a bit of React or something can go a long way. This should exist in a repo (can be the same repo as the backend), and it should be built/deployed to S3 via GitHub Actions.\n\nYour application should be served entirely through CloudFront. The front-end should be served out of S3 through CloudFront and cached appropriately. The backend can live in the same CloudFront distribution and served out of API Gateway. The front-end should then be able to communicate with the backend this way.\n\nThe application should be able to do *something* with the database. Doesn't really matter what, as long as your application can properly connect to the database (probably using credentials fetched from Secrets Manager).\n\nIn the end, you should be able to push a change to the repo and the whole thing should deploy automatically.\n\nOnce you do this, do it again, and again, etc., adding in more services, complexity, etc., as you go. Make sure costs are under control, things scale, things are secure, etc. This process should become second nature to you. Bonus points for using an EC2 server to work out of. I prefer to use EC2 and connect to it via VSCode tunneling. Working out of an EC2 instance can help in a lot of different ways, but being able to do so, in itself, goes a long way.\n\nFrom there, you'd be a pretty valuable asset to a lot of organizations who aren't very familiar with the cloud.",

If you have 5 years of full-time experience and you're talking to an interviewer, they will only ever \"see\" a tiny fraction of that experience. Despite working tens of thousands of hours, interacting with dozens of different people, handling all sorts of weird cases and challenges, etc., you *must* boil all of that down into a relatively extremely short conversation. Furthermore, you're trying to sell you present and future self while only having evidence of your past self. Even if something clicked in your thought process last night that made you a real wiz in this stuff, you can only really share your experiences from the past where you likely weren't as good as you are now.\n\nSo, with all of that being said, it's important to sell yourself, and that will require you to effectively fill in the gaps that naturally arise in this situation. That doesn't mean you straight-up lie about scenarios, *especially* if those lies imply you can do things that you can't. But if you're confident that you *could* do something that you know they'd want you to be able to do, despite having never actually done that thing, then I think it's reasonable to present an actual situation you've been in in a way that communicates that to them. If you have to bend the truth a bit to really sell your story, then so be it. Odds are whatever story you tell won't be consistent with other's version of the same story anyways, so some idea of object \"truth\" isn't really practically real.\n\nI think this is one of those things that people learn as they just experience life. The past is necessarily a bastardized, biased narrative where you typically have to fill in missing details, and if you're doing so anyways, you might as well fill in those details such that the overall story is more effective. Is it lying? On a practical level, only if you saying something verifiably falseable. My policy is to only say things that I'm willing to have everybody I know hear and be able to call me out on (e.g., assume the interviewer is actually personal friends with my manager, previous employers, parents, etc., and expect they'll scrutinize every little detail of our conversation). If I wouldn't be willing to defend what I said in that context, then I won't say it. But you should be able to see that that still leaves a lot of room to tell a story that puts you in a better light than if you only rattled off the absolute objective truth.\n\nI'll add that I once worked with someone who straight-up lied about their experience, etc. It was very clear to me that they were under experienced and weren't long for the job *before* they decided to tell me that was the case (they were quite smug about how effectively they lied to get the job) while we were having a one-on-one offboarding meeting which they didn't realize was the case. That was an eye-opener in terms of seeing how blatant people are willing to lie, how effectively lying can be to get a job, and how ineffective lying ends up being in the long run.",
