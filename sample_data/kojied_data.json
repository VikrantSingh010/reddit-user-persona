            "selftext": "There's this bar that I frequent a few blocks away from my house. Technically different neighborhood, but generally has a mature vibe with people who like music and to dance. Today when I went to the bar and all of a sudden I felt like I was at a college basement party. I thought that I must have been hallucinating, but Then a girl pointed at me and referred to me as the old person. That's when I knew I had to get out of there.\n I was at the wrong party. \n\nAs I walk back home, all of a sudden I realize that there were now tens of thousands of 18 year-old 19 year-old 20-year-olds who were all living on top of each other and were super young and horny to basically use the New York nightlife as their own personal orgy dome.\n Naturally I felt violated\n\nBut then again, I thought to myself. Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city. They might only be here for three months, but I've only been here for three years as well. As a matter fact, there are bunch of people have done this for generations where their parents and their grandparents and their grandparents all met in New York, and they all decided to live somewhere in the broader region whether it be Westchester, Wilmington, Big Indian, Boston, etc. \nNew York City is equally adventurous to each, so who am I to judge how others enjoy this adventurous city.",

With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next \"Pokemon Go\" that would propel their franchise to the next level.\n\nBeing Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP.\n\n*What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them.*\n\nI'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.\n\n[personal info redacted for obvious reasons](https://preview.redd.it/be7qbqfg5qgc1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=21fec81575a29fa53fc01639e368980dc4c5ac6f)",

I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it\u2019s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much\u2026\n\nAlso where\u2019s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a \u201cwork device\u201d, they gotta have at least Xcode right?\n\nI can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can\u2019t replace my entire workflow, I don\u2019t know if I can justify the price. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you\u2019d like to see ASAP.",

The whole concept is something that mostly grew into a concept in the UK around 1824. 1824 is the year the Oxford English Dictionary defined \"archaeology\" a word.\n\n(Btw our generation will be remembered for our new additions which include anti-work, curry laksa, diet-busting, final frontier, fugazi, gajillion, skellington, straight-talking, stonkingly, voguing,etc.)\n\nBack to the main topic, what I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s pretty easy for the \u201c1%\u201d to control the \u201cstory of our world\u201d through archeologists and historians.

Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.\n\n**Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?**\n\nI feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.\n\nThe current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.\n\nThe first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/) has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)\n\nPlease let me know what you think!\n\nIndividual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.",

But is there a way to better understand what we get our \"gratification\" from, and track this?\n\nMy initial idea was an app that would enable users to track the \"gratification\" they receive from their purchases. If you regret what you bought, you can record a decline in the gratification, or if you found the purchase better than you expected, you can record an increase.\n\nOf course, this would not necessarily apply to all purchases.

I found linksDAO to be an interesting concept of fractionally owning a golf course, and they're still active but not much hype around them anymore either. Most major brand NFT collaborations have died down as well  \n\\- the NFT craze has not settled into something sustainable, it's dead. Can it come back? Possibly, it has happened before, when cryptopunks and cryptokitties were first hot in 2017-ish, then died, then came back during 2020-2022.  \n\\- will there be a big boom? I personally don't think it would in the way we think of NFTs as collectables. A major thesis was around digital scarcity, and that seemed possible during covid, but post covid people went back to f2f interactions. Digital scarcity could become a hot topic again if we see a broader adoption of VR or even XR, but that seems a bit down the line. I think fractional ownership of assets could be interesting, but they'd just be fungible tokens, not NFT\n\nI see so many one-off posts on this community with only a couple responses. Can't believe there's 2.7M members here. That alone should tell you that NFTs are no longer something people are interested in. I'd love to be proven wrong, since I feel that there was alot of potential, but so far it seems like the community is dead",
